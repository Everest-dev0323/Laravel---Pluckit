<h2>G'day,</h2>
<br/>
<h2>A big welcome to Pluckit!</h2>
<br/>
We want to take a moment to say thank you, and we're glad to see you're on board with our mission. We're taking word of mouth and trust to a new level. If you can't trust those closest to you, who can you trust? 
<br/>
<br/>
We hope we can help you find more trusted, reliable and high quality tradies and get those much needed jobs DONE. 
<br/>
<br/>
As a first step, on your profile you'll see an option to import your contacts. This way, we can see if anyone you know has left any recommendations for you to then base your decisions off. It's completely private and secure and it's only visible for when you search.
<br/>
<br/>
You can <a href="{{ url('/home?login=1') }}">login</a> here.
<br/>
<br/>
If there's anything else we can do to help, please get in touch via info@pluckit.com.au
<br/>
<br/>
We look forward to our partnership and building more trust in the online world together. 

<br/>

Cheers,<br/>
The Pluckit team.</b>
